## README

### Introduction

Hello and welcome to the SARS-Genome ML Project! This study aims to examine and comprehend the genome sequencing of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses using machine learning techniques. This README file offers a description of the project, its goals, and how to efficiently use the offered code and resources.

### Project Overview

Sequencing the genome of viruses like SARS is crucial for understanding their structure, evolution, and potential treatments. Machine learning plays a significant role in analyzing large genome datasets, identifying patterns, and making predictions. In this project, we aim to:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather genome sequencing data for various SARS strains, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean, align, and preprocess the genome data to make it suitable for machine learning.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract meaningful features from genome sequences, such as codon usage, protein motifs, and more.

4. **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models to predict various aspects of SARS viruses, such as virulence, drug resistance, or mutation patterns.

5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to interpret and communicate the results effectively.

### Getting Started

To start working with the SARS-Genome ML project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SARS-Genome-ML.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Collection**: You may need to collect genome sequencing data from reputable sources or provide your dataset. Place the data in a designated directory (e.g., `data/`).

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the provided preprocessing scripts (if available) to clean and format your data appropriately. Refer to the `data_preprocessing/` directory.

5. **Feature Extraction**: Implement feature extraction methods in the `feature_extraction/` directory. Ensure that extracted features are stored in a suitable format for modeling.

6. **Model Development**: Create machine learning models in the `models/` directory. You can use libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Evaluate and tune your models for optimal performance.

7. **Visualization**: Use visualization scripts (if provided) in the `visualization/` directory to present your results effectively.
